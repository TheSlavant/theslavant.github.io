Currently splitting my time between tinkering with neural nets (especially LLMs) and figuring out the next problem to work on. You can see the problems I'm researching [here](/problems/). 

I tend to have a great time meeting people. Don't hesitate to reach out at shipilovya [at] gmail [dot] com or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yaroshipilov). I'm happy to brainstorm with you, review your post draft, or chat / meet up in general.

Here are some things I've worked on in the past. This list is a work in progress.

### Steller

The goal of Steller was to find talented people in remote parts of the world and introduce them to the idea and practice of research. 

We matched high-school students from Russia, Kazakhstan, and India with professors at Princeton and Yale to work on research in Machine Learning, Biology, and Law. Several students reported that Steller changed their lives and helped them decide on a career path.

My cofounder and I named the program after [G.W.Steller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Steller), a German-born botanist who made most of his contributions while working in the Russian Empire, to symbolize that talent should be applied where it can be applied best.

When I started Steller, Stephen Wolfram warned me that discovering talented young people at scale is a hard problem. Before they've made major (in some cases, any) achievements, young people's potential is far from obvious. And most undiscovered talent, by definition, hasn't shown itself in a way that's easy to spot from the other side of the world. With Steller, we succeeded on a small scale, but we, too, hit a snag with scaling our approach. 

I still think this is possible with a different approach. I learned a lot and will likely work on this problem more in the future.
