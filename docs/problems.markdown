### **Accelerating science**

Personas

1. **Scientists** doing research
2. **Philanthropists** donating to science
3. **Investors** investing in science
4. **Companies** that want to use scientific research to build products
5. **Focused research organizations** attempting new ways of doing research

Problems

- What’s the best funding structure for science?
- What institutions of science are the most productive? How can we scale them?
- How can we make it easier for companies to use scientific research to build products?
- How can we use AI to accelerate science?
- What's the successor to the scientific paper and the scientific journal?
    
    > Are LaTeX'd papers and paid journals really the best we can do? [Peer review](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/peer-review-not-old-you-might-think) and [modern scientific publishing](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science) are quite recent phenomena. In different ways, [Distill](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/), [the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [Fermat's Library](http://fermatslibrary.com/), and [Sci-Hub](https://scihub22266oqcxt.onion.link/) hint that improvement might be possible.

### **AI alignment**

Problems
- How do we know if the LLM is being truthful and complete in its answers?
- How do we align LLMs on modes where RLHF fails, e.g. introspecive reasoning?
- What can we learn from inverse scaling?
- How can we improve the way AI models are shared, bought/sold, and deployed?
- How can we make LLMs “get us”, so they can provide the best possible answer given more general prompts?

### **Education & human potential**

Personas

2. **Parents** wanting to give their children the best chance of success in life
4. **Schools** that want to attract and graduate top talent
5. **Young adults** wanting to get on their feet, maximize their chances of success and find their purpose
6. **Young researchers** that want to get assistants
8. **Universities** that want to attract and graduate top talent
10. **Companies** that want to hire and develop top talent
11. **Older adults** wanting to shift careers, stay relevant, or find their purpose

Problems

- Can we give each child an AI language tutor since birth to get them fluent in 3-4 languages?
